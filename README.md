# RydeBordinCosta

Assignment 1 for Advanced Mobile App Development. 

Goal of the assignment is to re-create a ride sharing application like that of Uber or Lyft.
Users can enter in either Sheridan Brampton or Sheridan Oakville or The Boot Social and the application will calculate fair for the trip.
Users can also enter in whether they will be riding with RydePool(Discounted fair, but more passengers). During surge hours (4-6pm) prices
are more expensive.
